## 1-3. ðŸ¥’ Live Streaming

Streamers who are my friends may live stream without notice.

## 1-4. ðŸ¥’ Server Rules

If you violate any of the following rules, **even once**, you will be subject to immediate and permanent banning..  
In general, if the moderators determine that your behavior is malicious or detrimental in any way, it will be considered a violation.

- Be considerate and do not harass (do not steal people's items, do not destroy people's buildings, do not occupy items, do not overload the server, try to communicate with Japanese and English speakers as much as possible using translation tools and more, etc.)
- Prohibited actions and constructions that violate public order and morals. Please also be mindful of Japanese laws regarding copyright and other legal regulations, as well as the terms and policies of YouTube.
- Do not interfere with the live stream (You can't put a damper on the future plans and current excitement of the live stream.). Also, please avoid special events (such as defeating the Ender Dragon) when playing without Ecma Kawarabe (me).
- Transparent skins and skins featuring characters without proper copyright ownership are not allowed (when in doubt, use a normal skin!).
- Please write your name near your own constructions! If you want to make any modifications that may affect areas beyond your own, be sure to consult with others!
- Chests without names written on them outside of buildings are considered free chests, but please remember to consider the feelings of others, such as "others might want them too" or "the person who put might not want everything to be taken."
