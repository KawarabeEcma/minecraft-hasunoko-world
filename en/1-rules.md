# 1. 🥒 Rules

## 1-1. 🥒 Player Name

As a fundamental requirement, please ensure that the username in the YouTube comment section and the player name are the same person, allowing for easy identification.
Do not use names beginning with "BE\_".

e.g.

- YouTube: Taro → Minecraft: Taro, Taro1234
- YouTube: Jack(Tom) → Minecraft: Tom, Tom1234, Jack, Jack1234

## 1-2. 🥒 Multiple creators are participating

Other creators participating without notice may be streaming or recording videos.

## 1-3. 🥒 House Rules

If you violate any of the following rules, you will generally receive a **permanent one-strike BAN**.  
**Even if not explicitly stated**, actions deemed malicious by the administration may result in consequences.

### ⛏ Show Consideration and Avoid Harassment

- Do not steal others' items.
- Do not destroy other players' buildings.
- Do not hog items.
  - 💡 If you take a large amount of items, make sure to share them with everyone.
  - 💡 Feel free to consult us if you have concerns.
- Do not avoid communication with Japanese or English speakers.
  - 💡 Try to use English at least when chatting or writing on signs!
  - 💡 Try to communicate using translation tools or other means!

and so on.

### ⛏ Prohibition of Acts Contrary to Public Morals and Order, Including Building

Please also be mindful of copyright and YouTube's terms of use.

### ⛏ Interference with Streamers and Content Creators is Prohibited

In essence, read the room 😂  
Also, please refrain from hosting special events (such as defeating the Ender Dragon) outside of streaming.

### ⛏ About Skins

Transparent skins and the use of characters for which you do not hold the copyright are prohibited.  
(If you're not sure, stick to a normal skin!)

### ⛏ Write Your Name!

Please write your name near your constructions.

- If you want to make changes that will affect others as well, consult with them!
- Let's also consider the future, such as whether the owner of the building might want it to be slightly expanded!

### ⛏ Shared Chests

Chests outside buildings without names written on them are considered free chests!  
However, please remember the feelings of "Others might want this too? I don't want everything to be taken" while using them.
