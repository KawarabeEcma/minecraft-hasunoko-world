### ⛏ Prohibition of Acts Contrary to Public Morals and Order, Including Building

Please also be mindful of copyright and YouTube's terms of use.

In essence, read the room 😂  
Also, please refrain from hosting special events (such as defeating the Ender Dragon) outside of streaming.

### ⛏ About Skins

Transparent skins and the use of characters for which you do not hold the copyright are prohibited.  
(If you're not sure, stick to a normal skin!)

### ⛏ Write Your Name!

Please write your name near your constructions.

- If you want to make changes that will affect others as well, consult with them!
- Let's also consider the future, such as whether the owner of the building might want it to be slightly expanded!

### ⛏ Shared Chests

Chests outside buildings without names written on them are considered free chests!  
However, please remember the feelings of "Others might want this too? I don't want everything to be taken" while using them.
